title:  "First Pre-release of Version 0.15 Released!"

The first pre-release version of 0.15 has just been released! As outlined in
our [previous post]({% post_url 2016-05-06-a-glimpse-at-the-future-of-caf %}),
this version comes with breaking changes. However, we think the end result is
well worth it. This release is the result of 8 months of development and 374
commits.

The best starting points to learn the new API is to read the
[examples](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/tree/master/examples)
and the extensively updated manual (as
[HTML](http://actor-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or
[PDF](http://www.actor-framework.org/develop/pdf/manual.pdf)).
Special thanks go to our early adopters for feedback, discussion, and bug
fixing!

Our goal with this pre-release is to stabilize the API. We have one planned
feature for the next pre-release that allows users to write
[less boilerplate](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/issues/470)
code for serialization and string conversion. However, this change will be
backwards compatible. Please do not hesitate to propose changes to the current
API [on GitHub](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/issues/468).

By the way, configuring your CAF application is now incredibly easy. We support
CLI options as well as separate INI files. The new manual has an entire
[section](http://actor-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ConfiguringActorApplications.html)
dedicated to the new extensible config mechanism.

We plan to release the next pre-release end of July. Whether or not we release
a third pre-release version depends on the amount of user feedback we get (and
how many bugs we find). If all goes well, we will ship 0.15 in August.
