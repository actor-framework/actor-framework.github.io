We gladly announce the second pre-release of CAF version 0.15. A big thank you
goes to our early adopters! You helped us to improve CAF with reports on bugs
and API flaws on the mailing list as well as on GitHub. Needless to say, this
release contains many bug fixes as a result. Further, our new
[type inspection](http://actor-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TypeInspection.html)
API is now in place. You can also
[spawn actors remotely](http://actor-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RemoteSpawn.html)
using our new experimental API.

CAF now enters the feature freeze phase and we are confident to ship 0.15 end
of August.
